                        <h2>About Us</h2>
                        <p>Civic Labs is a software consulting company started by Brandon Stiles in October of 2014, in San Francisco, California, United States.</p>

                    <p>From the beginning, we knew we could help businesses successfully create and launch software products that are not only highly profitable - but also truly help people. While the company, by any measure, is small, we've built a meaningful network of local advisers and software engineers. These people all share our vision, and have contributed in countless and meaningful ways.</p>
                    <p>Over the past couple year we have had the pleasure of working with a variety of clients in numerous industries all over the US. From media and entertainment companies in Hollywood, CA, to medical enterprises in Austin, TX... all the way to music distribution businesses in Brooklyn, NY. Just to name a few. So what's the common thread? Software products that all add incredible business value.</p>
