                        <h2>About Us</h2>
                        <p>Civic Labs is a software consulting firm started by Brandon Stiles in October of 2014, in San Francisco, California, United States.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>From the beginning, we knew we could help businesses successfully create software products that are not only highly profitable - but also truly help people. While the company, by any measure, is small, we've built a powerful network of local advisers and software engineers, along with a collection of offshore subcontractors, along the way. And these people all share my vision, and have contributed in countless and meaningful ways.</p>
                    <p>Over the past couple year we have worked with a variety of clients in numerous industries all over the US. From media and entertainment companies in Hollywood, CA, to medical enterprises in Austin, TX... all the way to music distribution businesses in Brooklyn, NY. Just to name a few. So what's the common thread? Software products that all add incredible value.</p>

                <h2>WE BELIEVE IN BUILDING THE HIGHEST QUALITY SOFTWARE PRODUCTS</h2>
                <h3>Multiply Your ROI</h3>
                <p>How can we multiply your ROI? There's no secret: we work with you and your business to figure out what exactly makes you money or saves you time, and what doesn't. Then we create a roadmap of how to get there, and then implement it. But our true advantage is in our experience and the technology we use. The same technology used in world class medical and financial applications. Click here to learn more about our most valued technologies.</p>
                <h3>Our Process</h3>
                <p>We put great effort into ensuring that working with us is a seamless process. The steps, from start to finish, are below. After new client qualification, the process is described below.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Product Roadmapping</li>
                    <li>Development</li>
                    <li>Maintenance and Support</li>
                </ul>
                <br/>
                <p>First, we make sure we're a good fit for each other - this is the most important step. Next, we'll meet in person or remotely to discuss your business and what the solution to your problem looks like. After, we'll submit a proposal based on your roadmapping session. Following that, we'll begin development, incrementing in small phases so that each phase ends with a working, usable product. After User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is complete, your product will go live and we'll begin the maintenance and support period.</p>
