These mathematial artificts are created using interactive theorem prooving langauges.</p>
                    <p>Of course there are many levels of correctness. Not all software applications have equal imporantce.

                <h2>WE BELIEVE IN BUILDING THE HIGHEST QUALITY SOFTWARE PRODUCTS</h2>
                <h3>Multiply Your ROI</h3>
                <p>How can we multiply your return on investment? Its no secret: we work with you and your business to figure out what exactly makes you money or saves you time, and what doesn't. Then we create a roadmap of how to get there, and then implement it. Our advantage lies in our experience and the technology we use.</p>
                <h3>Our Process</h3>
                <p>We put great effort into ensuring working with us to create a product is a seamless process. The steps, from start to finish, are below. After a new client is qualified to work with us, the following process unfolds.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Product Roadmapping</li>
                    <li>Development</li>
                    <li>Maintenance and Support</li>
                </ul>
                <br/>
                <p>First, we make sure we're a good fit for each other - this is the most important step. Next, we'll meet in person or remotely to discuss your business and what the solution to your problem looks like. After, we'll submit a proposal based on your roadmapping session. Following that, we'll begin development, incrementing in small phases so that each deliberable ends with a working, usable product. After User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is complete, your product will go live and we'll begin the maintenance and support period.</p>
