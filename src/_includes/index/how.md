### With Technology

At Civic Labs we are heavily invested in a few key technologies that allow us to do what we do: build high quality software. Specifically, certified programming, a kind of computer software application development that facilitates the creation of mathematically provably correct software via functional programming.

Certified software is guaranteed to meet a formal specification and is usually done by means of a generated or derived mathematical artifact. These mathematical artifacts are mostly created using interactive theorem proving programming languages like Coq. Haskell, to a lesser degree, offers similar benefits to Coq, albeit on a less rigorous level.
