Why should you hire a small software shop over a larger company to build or enhance your next software product? The reason is that software has diseconomies of scale - not economies of scale. Allan Kelly perfectly describes this phenomenon in his <a href="http://allankelly.blogspot.com/2015/10/software-has-diseconomies-of-scale-not.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>.

## 1. Reduce Risk

Working in the large increases risk. Straight from Allan Kelly's blog, he describe the heart of the difference. To summarize Kelly's main points, the diseconomies are everywhere:
<br/>
<br/>
> Small teams frequently outperform large team, five people working as a tight team will be far more productive per person than a team of 50, or even 15
>
> The more lines of code a piece of software has the more difficult it is to add an enhancement or fix a bug; putting a fix into a system with 1 million lines can easily be more than 10 times harder than fixing a system with 100,000 lines
>
> Projects which set out to be BIG have far higher costs and lower productivity (per unit of deliverable) than small systems
>
> Waiting longer - and probably writing more code - before you ask for feedback or user validation causes more problems than asking for it sooner when the product is smaller

This may or may not be obvious, but in my own experience, I can anecdotally say that working in small groups *always* promotes clearer, meaningful communication and more productive relationships. This in turn creates better products, which increases customer satisfaction.

## 2. Offer Highly Niche Services

With the proliferation of more smaller and smaller shops cropping up, it only makes sense that the small shops adjust their focus according to compete against the "Big Guys" buy specializing on something in particular. In the case of Civic Labs, this focus is on Haskell and Coq programming.

## 3. Turnaround Products Faster

Ever heard of the bikeshed problem, or [Law of Triviality](https://goo.gl/iTFs7c)? This is the idea that the more unqualified people are involved in a decision, the less likely the decision is to be good for the entire group. This also applies to discussion: the more people involved in a discussion who aren't experts on the topic, the more time will be spent on details that do not matte.
