Why should you hire a small software shop over a larger company to build or enhance your next software product? The reason is that software has diseconomies of scale - not economies of scale. To sum it up:

## 1. Reduce Risk

Straight from Allan Kelly's blog, he describe the heart of the difference.

Allan Kelly perfectly describes this phenomenon in his <a href="http://allankelly.blogspot.com/2015/10/software-has-diseconomies-of-scale-not.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>.

## 2. Offer Highly Niche Services

With the proliferation of more smaller and smaller shops cropping up, it only makes sense that the small shops adjust their focus according to compete against the "Big Guys" buy specializing on something in particular. In the case of Civic Labs, this focus is on Haskell and Coq programming.

## 3. Increased Customer Focus
